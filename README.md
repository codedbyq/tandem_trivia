# Tandem Trivia 
### [Live Demo](https://www.marquisbentley.com/tandem_trivia)
I created a lightweight and fun application application that displays trivia questions with multiple-choice answers to select from. Check out a live demo [here](https://www.marquisbentley.com/tandem_trivia).

## Getting started
Tandem Trivia is hosted using github pages so you can play the game in browser without downloading the files, just follow the link above. If you would like to run locally that can be done very easily as well! The game is built with vanilla Javascript so just follow these steps:
1. Download the repo and unzip
2. Open up your terminal and CD into the folder
3. Run ```npm install``` to install the dependencies
4. Run ```npm start``` to run the webpack bundler
5. Open the index.html file in Google Chrome and start playing!
